# RealTimeCuttingAlgorithmDemo
A cutting algorithm utilizing the Tri-Dexel data structure to fast construct cutting surfaces. The cutting algrothim is implemented and executed in the compute shader to achieve parallel computing. Due to confidential issues, the full project is currently archived.


Cutting surfaces immediately appear after the cut is performed on the virtual object.

Cut-out part is independent to the orginal object, and could perform its own behavior.
