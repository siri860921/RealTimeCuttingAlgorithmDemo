# RealTimeCuttingAlgorithmDemo
A cutting algorithm utilizing the Tri-Dexel data structure to fast construct cutting surfaces. The cutting algrothim is implemented and executed in the compute shader to achieve parallel computing. Due to confidential issues, the full project is currently archived.


The cutting surfaces appear immediately after the cut is performed.
